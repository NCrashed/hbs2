-- | 'gitCanon' against real git.
--
-- The one part of reading canon that cannot be checked against a tree in memory,
-- because what it does IS talk to git: parse an @ls-tree -l@ record, tell the
-- exit codes of @rev-parse@ apart, and resolve paths from the root of the tree
-- rather than from wherever the caller happens to be standing.
--
-- Each of those has been wrong once already. The listing parser is the one with
-- no natural alarm: it drops what it cannot read, so a format shift would empty
-- the listing and print a clean empty audit, which is the failure the reader is
-- built to not have.
